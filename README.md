# Plan<br />
<br />
- Multiple inputs from OBS (via Mux)
 - Main feed
 - Onboard cameras
- Customers can switch between feeds/arrange feeds such as in F1 TV
- Quality changer (up to 1080p 60fps)
- Option to display 'clean feed' (without broadcast overlay, so this needs to be displayed over the top in the website not OBS)
- Paying customers get access to instant replay function, exclusive shows, chat
- Live data
 - Leaderboard
 - Track map
- System similar to floatplane for multiple leagues
- Leagues register and pay for access (similar to Grid Finder)
- Can add multiple staff, e.g. 
 - Owner who has total access
 - Broadcaster who has access to stream controls and replay files
 - Replay manager who has access to replay functionality with ability to create replay files and then flag them to the broadcaster
 - Moderator who has access to chat control
 - Camera Operator who has access to stream to the website
 - Commentator who has access to all feeds and layers
- VODs saved to each leagueâ€™s page and can be categorised into series
<br />
## Extras<br />
<br />
- Option to hire broadcasters/commentators/managers on an as-needed or per-season basis
